## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. Most important libraries include:

* data handling including pandas, numpy
* data visualization including matplotlib, seaborn
* sklearn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of the Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Captone project, Starbucks has kindly provided simulated promotional datasets that mimic customer behavior on the rewards mobile app. Analysis of the data could be helpful for understanding customer behaviors, making business decision, and implementing strategies to improve the business profits.

In this analysis, we are interested in the following questions:

1. What are the demographic data of the customers?
2. How various genders respond to the promotions differently?
3. What is the best channel to send out promotions?
4. Of all the different promotional offers, which one is more profitable for Starbucks?
5. Can we build a model to predict the customers' behavior and send out customized promotional offers to individuals?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are three files in ./data folder (credits to Starbucks and Udacity):

* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
* profile.json - demographic data for each customer
* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

All the analysis are combined in one single notebook `starbucks_capstone.ipynb`. The notebook is exploratory with titles and sections to showcase work relatd to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](xxx).

Credit to Starbucks and Udacity for the data. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
